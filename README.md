# SwiftUI-Weather-App
A clean, UI-only SwiftUI Weather App built for practice. It uses @State, @Binding, subviews, and custom colors with full support for light and dark modes. Focuses on layout, code refactoring, and modular design using SwiftUI stacks, making it a great learning and portfolio project.
