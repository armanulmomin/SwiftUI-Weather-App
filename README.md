# üå§Ô∏è WeatherAppUI - SwiftUI UI Practice Project

This is a **UI-focused Weather App** built using **SwiftUI**, created purely for practicing and showcasing SwiftUI techniques. The app simulates a weather forecast screen and demonstrates clean code organization, component-based design, and support for both dark and light modes.

## ‚ú® Features Practiced

### ‚úÖ SwiftUI Concepts
- **@State**: Manage local state for dynamic views
- **@Binding**: Pass and update state between parent and child views
- **Color Scheme**: Designed to work with both **Dark** and **Light Mode**
- **Code Refactoring**: Extracted reusable components into subviews
- **SubViews**: Modular UI using `WeatherDayView`, `MainWeatherStatusView`, and more
- **Custom Colors**: Used `Asset Catalog` for consistent color themes


- **SwiftUI**
- **Xcode Previews**
- **MV-like UI structure** (Not full MVVM since this is UI-only)
- **Dark/Light mode adaptation**
- **Custom SwiftUI modifiers**
